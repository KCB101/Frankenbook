The housing parts were printed from stainless steel. These parts had to be ground and cut quite a bit, as can be seen in the pictures.
The disk cover also warped during printing. Due to design rules from JLCPCB the holes had to be drilled out after printing. 
This needed carbite drills due to the material hardness.
