The keyboard handler is a copy of apples design. Its just a USB input device with native 
support on linux but not on windows. Due to some reason the trackpad wont work after being 
turned off and on again, which is necessary as the circuit uses a lot of power in idle.
This is also the reason the internal ports need port power control and why the rules given need
to be added. They restart the keybaord after its "plugged in".
The design uses the keyboard IC from the MacBook.
If you want to copy this be aware of the fact that the different years of MacBook use slightly 
different pinout on the IC.
