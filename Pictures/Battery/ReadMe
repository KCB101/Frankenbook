The battery consists of two framework 55 wh batteries soldered together.
As reprogramming the battery to accept the higher capacity would be a rather involved project
instead I just replaced the 3 mOhm shunt resistor with a 1.5 mOhm shunt. This causes the battery
to think its only drained half as fast and therefore accepts the higher capacity. Otherwise the
laptop would just turn of at half capacity. 
The three cables are the power cable, where I had to extend the original cable as the battery 
connector and crimps anre not easily available, one power plug that exposes the battery voltage
and ground and one SMBUS plug. I wanted to build a SMBUS charger but couldnt get it to get 
recognized by the system so instead I build a dumb charger. This causes the laptop to not 
recognize being charged. The chargestate is reported correctly but the OS doesnt show the battery
being charged.
The battery was then placed inside the hollowed out housing of a macbook battery.
