The screen used is a LP170WQ1-SPF2. It has the same connector and plug as the Framework 16 
display. Before the release of the Framework 16 I used a Framework 13 cable and an adapter as 
the Framework 13 display has a wider pitch. The screen is held in by a couple of pieces cut of 
from the original screen in areas cut out with a dremel on the top and the lip of the housing
on the bottom. Its bushed forward using some foam pieces.
